Here are the key optimizations you can apply to the provided code to enhance its performance:

### 1. **Expression Tree Reuse and Memoization**
   - **Reuse parsed expression trees:** Once an expression has been parsed into an expression tree, reuse it if the same expression is evaluated multiple times, avoiding re-parsing for identical expressions.
   - **Memoize function evaluations:** Function evaluation could be expensive, especially for recursive functions or functions with heavy computation. Cache function results with argument values (if not already cached) to avoid recalculating them for the same inputs.
   
### 2. **Symbol Lookup Optimization**
   - **Improve symbol lookup in `SymbolTable`:** Symbol lookup occurs frequently, so consider using optimized hash table libraries (like `google::dense_hash_map`) instead of standard `std::unordered_map`, which offers better performance for large datasets.
   - **Inline constant lookup:** For constants, look them up once during tree construction and store their values directly in the node (replacing the variable node with a number node).

### 3. **Expression Simplification at Parse Time**
   - **Pre-simplification:** Perform aggressive expression simplification during the parsing phase (i.e., folding constants and eliminating redundant terms like `0 + x` or `x * 1`) rather than on-the-fly during evaluation. This reduces the depth and complexity of the expression tree, improving runtime performance.
   
### 4. **Lazy Evaluation of Expressions**
   - **Use lazy evaluation:** For complex expressions, delay evaluation until a result is absolutely needed. This can be applied to sub-expressions whose values might never be needed in certain conditions (e.g., short-circuiting logical operators like `&&` and `||`).
   
### 5. **Avoid Repeated Heap Allocations**
   - **Pre-allocate memory for tree nodes:** Instead of using `std::make_unique` repeatedly to allocate tree nodes, consider using a memory pool (or arena allocator) for faster allocation and deallocation. This is especially useful if the solver will be used frequently and generate many nodes.
   
### 6. **Optimize Cache Usage**
   - **Use a more efficient cache structure:** Depending on the usage pattern of the `expressionCache` and `functionCache`, consider more efficient caching strategies like an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache or LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache to avoid unnecessary cache evictions.
   - **Optimize cache keys:** Instead of hashing the entire expression or function call, generate shorter, unique identifiers for the expression/function for faster key comparisons in the cache.
   
### 7. **Reduce Overhead in Tokenization**
   - **Optimize tokenization process:** Tokenization is done for every expression evaluation. Use techniques like state machines or a `std::vector<Token>` that pre-allocates space for known token lengths to reduce heap allocations.
   - **Use a lookup table for operators:** Instead of repeatedly checking operators with `if-else` conditions in `evaluateNode`, use a pre-built lookup table for operator handling, speeding up evaluation of binary expressions.

### 8. **Parallelization**
   - **Parallelize `evaluateForRange`:** The `evaluateForRange` method evaluates the same expression over multiple variable values. This is a natural candidate for parallelism using threads or modern parallelization techniques (like OpenMP or C++'s standard `std::async`) since each evaluation is independent.
   
### 9. **Function Inlining and Unrolling**
   - **Function inlining:** In frequently called small functions (e.g., `evaluateNode`, `declareVariable`, `declareConstant`), consider marking them as `inline` or use compiler-specific hints like `[[gnu::always_inline]]` to encourage the compiler to inline these functions and reduce function call overhead.
   
### 10. **Batch Variable Updates**
   - **Batch variable declarations:** Instead of declaring variables one by one (which invalidates the cache for each call), allow the declaration of multiple variables in one call. This reduces overhead from repeated cache invalidations and lookups.

### 11. **Operator Overloading and Arithmetic Shortcuts**
   - **Overload arithmetic operators for `ExprNode`:** For expressions like `evaluateNode`, you can overload arithmetic operators for `ExprNode` objects to remove redundant control flow logic from `evaluateNode`, reducing runtime branching.
   - **Precompute inverse values:** For division operations, instead of repeatedly dividing by a number, precompute and store the inverse when possible.

### 12. **Remove Redundant Evaluations**
   - **Skip evaluations for unchanged sub-expressions:** If parts of an expression do not depend on the variables (i.e., they only involve constants), evaluate them once and reuse the result for subsequent evaluations.

### 13. **Use Move Semantics Efficiently**
   - **Leverage move semantics effectively:** Ensure that you're taking full advantage of move semantics (e.g., use `std::move` in cases where `ExprNode` or large objects are returned or passed into functions) to avoid unnecessary deep copies of large objects or trees.

### 14. **Avoid Exception Overhead**
   - **Minimize exception handling overhead:** In performance-critical sections, avoid using exceptions for control flow (e.g., division by zero). Handle common cases with normal checks and reserve exceptions for truly exceptional conditions.

### 15. **Improve Debugging**
   - **Use conditional logging:** In the current code, there's quite a bit of debugging output (`std::cout`) when `debug` is true. If possible, minimize the overhead by having more efficient debugging mechanisms like logging to memory buffers or using conditional breakpoints.

By applying a combination of these strategies, you can significantly improve the performance of the `Solver` class in both evaluation speed and memory management.
