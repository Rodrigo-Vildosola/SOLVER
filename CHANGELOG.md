## **Changelog: Performance Enhancements & Features for Solver Library**

### **Version 1.1.0 - Optimization and Performance Improvements**

#### **1. Memoization for Function Calls**
   - **Description**: Cache results of user-defined and predefined function calls to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Speeds up repeated evaluations of functions with the same arguments by returning cached results.
   - **Details**: 
     - Implement caching in `evaluateFunction`.
     - Use a `std::unordered_map` with unique keys based on function names and arguments to store and retrieve previously computed values.

#### **2. Precompute Function Expression Trees**
   - **Description**: Parse and convert function expressions to expression trees when the function is declared, rather than on every evaluation.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Reduces parsing overhead by avoiding repeated parsing of function expressions.
   - **Details**:
     - Pre-build the expression tree when calling `declareFunction`.
     - Reuse the pre-built tree in `evaluateFunction` to skip parsing during each evaluation.

#### **3. Expression Tree Simplification**
   - **Description**: Automatically simplify the expression tree by folding constants and applying algebraic simplifications (e.g., `x + 0 = x`).
   - **Expected Benefit**: Reduces tree size and optimizes execution by eliminating redundant computations.
   - **Details**:
     - Implement more robust constant folding during tree construction.
     - Add simplification for basic algebraic operations like multiplication/division by 1 or 0.

#### **4. Optimize Shunting Yard Algorithm**
   - **Description**: Improve the efficiency of the Shunting Yard algorithm used for infix-to-postfix conversion.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Speeds up parsing, especially for complex expressions.
   - **Details**:
     - Precompute operator precedence and store it in a `std::unordered_map` for faster lookups.
     - Reduce stack operations where possible, avoiding redundant pushes and pops.

#### **5. Lazy Evaluation for Constants**
   - **Description**: Implement lazy evaluation, where constant parts of the expression are evaluated only when needed.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Improves performance by deferring unnecessary computations until they are actually required.
   - **Details**:
     - Identify constant subtrees and mark them for lazy evaluation.
     - Evaluate constants only once, and reuse their values for subsequent evaluations.

#### **6. Inline Constants in Expression Trees**
   - **Description**: Replace constants in the expression tree during tree construction rather than during evaluation.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Reduces runtime lookups of constant values and simplifies the evaluation of constant-heavy expressions.
   - **Details**:
     - Detect constants during expression tree construction and insert their literal values directly.

#### **7. Parallel Evaluation for Independent Subtrees**
   - **Description**: Evaluate independent subtrees in parallel using multi-threading.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Speeds up evaluations of large or complex expressions where subtrees can be evaluated independently.
   - **Details**:
     - Use `std::async` or `std::thread` to evaluate left and right subtrees concurrently where applicable.
     - Ensure thread safety and proper synchronization for shared resources.

#### **8. Optimize Symbol Table Lookups**
   - **Description**: Improve the performance of constant and variable lookups in the `SymbolTable`.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Speeds up symbol retrieval by minimizing the overhead of frequent lookups.
   - **Details**:
     - Cache symbol lookups when a variable or constant is first accessed, reducing redundant lookups during subsequent evaluations.

#### **9. Batch Evaluations for Ranges of Values**
   - **Description**: Optimize the `evaluateForRange` function to handle batches of values more efficiently.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Reduces overhead for range evaluations, improving performance when computing values over large datasets.
   - **Details**:
     - Use batch processing techniques to minimize variable re-declaration overhead.
     - Optimize memory usage by preallocating storage for results.

#### **10. Improve Error Handling Efficiency**
   - **Description**: Reduce the overhead of exceptions in critical performance paths by using error codes where appropriate.
   - **Expected Benefit**: Faster evaluations by reducing the performance cost of throwing and catching exceptions in predictable cases.
   - **Details**:
     - Replace exception handling for predictable errors (e.g., division by zero) with return codes or error flags in non-critical sections.
     - Throw exceptions only in truly exceptional cases like invalid syntax or undeclared variables.
