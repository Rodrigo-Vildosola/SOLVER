### **Phase 1: Refactor and Modularize the Simplification Process**

1. **Separate Simplification Modules**:
   - Create a **`Simplification` namespace** or class that contains individual simplification functions for different types of simplifications.
   - Modularize existing simplifications (e.g., `applyBasicSimplifications`) into separate functions within this namespace.

2. **Implement a Rewrite System**:
   - Create a `RewriteRule` struct or class that defines a simplification rule. Each rule should include:
     - A **pattern** to match specific sub-expressions.
     - A **replacement** function that applies a transformation when the pattern matches.
   - Implement a **rule-based rewrite engine** that applies these rules recursively. This will serve as the core of your simplification system and will be extended in later phases.

3. **Add a Multi-Pass Simplifier**:
   - Create a **multi-pass simplifier** that organizes simplifications into passes, running simple rules first and then progressively more complex ones.
   - Allow each pass to run recursively until no further simplifications are made in that pass.
   
### **Phase 2: Implement Common Algebraic Simplifications**

1. **Associative and Commutative Pattern Matching (AC Matching)**:
   - Implement AC-matching support to recognize expressions that are equivalent under associativity and commutativity.
   - Add initial simplification rules for:
     - **Factor Out Terms** (e.g., `a*b + a*c -> a * (b + c)`).
     - **Combine Like Terms** (e.g., `x + x + x -> 3*x`).
   - Integrate these rules into your rewrite system.

2. **Polynomial Simplification**:
   - Implement polynomial simplification using **Horowitz’s algorithm** for factoring polynomial terms and organizing them by degree.
   - Create a helper function to **expand and collapse polynomials** to simplify expressions by distributing or factoring terms.

3. **Constant Folding**:
   - Extend constant folding beyond basic operations to handle nested constants.
   - Incorporate **division checks** to handle cases where a division by zero could occur.
   - Use the `RewriteRule` framework to add constant folding rules.

4. **Canonicalization**:
   - Implement a **canonicalization function** that standardizes expression formats, ordering terms, and sorting operators consistently.
   - Apply canonicalization during each pass to improve rule-matching consistency.

### **Phase 3: Implement Advanced Algebraic Simplification**

1. **Implement Partial Fraction Decomposition**:
   - Implement partial fraction decomposition for rational expressions (e.g., `(2x + 3)/(x^2 - x - 6)`).
   - Use **Heaviside’s method** for simple cases, aiming to split complex rational expressions into sums of fractions.

2. **Radical Simplification**:
   - Implement radical simplification using the **Risch-Norman algorithm**.
   - Add rules for **combining and simplifying square roots** and other radical terms.
   - Extend constant folding to handle **roots** and **powers** more thoroughly.

3. **Logarithmic and Exponential Simplification**:
   - Implement **Risch’s algorithm** or a modified version to handle logarithmic and exponential simplification.
   - Add simplification rules for common logarithmic transformations:
     - `ln(e^x) -> x`
     - `ln(a) + ln(b) -> ln(a * b)`.
   - Extend constant folding to recognize and simplify logarithmic and exponential constants.

### **Phase 4: Enhance Pattern Matching and Expression Parsing**

1. **Tree-based Pattern Matching**:
   - Enhance your rewrite system to support **tree-based patterns** so that complex patterns like `a*b + a*c` can be recognized and transformed.
   - Implement **wildcard patterns** to allow for flexible matching (e.g., matching any sub-expression `x` in a pattern like `x + x`).

2. **Introduce a Simplification Rule Registry**:
   - Use a **registry pattern** to dynamically load and organize simplification rules. This allows for rules to be loaded or prioritized based on context.
   - Define rule categories (e.g., polynomial rules, logarithmic rules) to control when each type of rule should be applied.

3. **Optimization of Expression Tree Canonicalization**:
   - Improve canonicalization by adding **heuristic sorting** for terms, further standardizing expressions.
   - Use a **hashing mechanism** on canonical forms to quickly detect equivalent sub-expressions.

### **Phase 5: Extend the Simplification System with User-defined Rules and Optimizations**

1. **Add Support for User-defined Rules**:
   - Allow users to define and register custom simplification rules at runtime. Implement a user-facing API for adding rules to the simplifier.
   - Create a **sandbox** for user-defined rules, allowing only safe transformations to be applied.

2. **Optimize Simplification Passes for Performance**:
   - Profile simplification passes to identify bottlenecks and implement caching for common sub-expressions.
   - Add a **deduplication pass** that eliminates duplicate subtrees or equivalent expressions to optimize storage.

3. **Error Handling and Safety Checks**:
   - Add safety checks to each simplification algorithm to avoid infinite loops or stack overflow from excessive recursion.
   - Integrate detailed error handling for edge cases, such as non-invertible expressions or expressions with undefined behavior.

4. **Document and Add Doxygen Comments**:
   - Add detailed Doxygen comments for each function, describing parameters, return values, and the intended simplification rule.
   - Document edge cases, assumptions, and computational complexity for each algorithm.

### **Phase 6: Testing and Validation**

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Create test cases for each simplification type (e.g., polynomials, radicals, logarithmic functions).
   - Include tests for complex cases that combine multiple simplification rules (e.g., `ln(a*b) + sqrt(c^2)`).

2. **Benchmark and Performance Optimization**:
   - Benchmark your simplification engine with large expressions and complex test cases to identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Optimize frequently used routines (e.g., constant folding, polynomial simplification) to reduce computation time.

3. **Extend the Rule Set Over Time**:
   - As additional simplification needs are identified, add them to the rule set as new `RewriteRule`s within the existing system.
   - Reevaluate and prioritize rules based on real-world usage and user feedback.
