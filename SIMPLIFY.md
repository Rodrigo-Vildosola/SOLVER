### 1. **Constant Folding** (Easiest)
   - **Description**: Evaluate constant subexpressions at compile-time instead of runtime.
   - **Example**: Simplify `3 + 5` to `8` or `2 * 2` to `4`.
   - **Why it's easy**: It's a direct evaluation of numeric constants and requires minimal tree restructuring.
   - **Steps**: 
     - Traverse the expression tree.
     - If both children of an operator are constants, compute and replace with a constant node.
   - **Expected Impact**: Immediate performance gain by reducing runtime computations.

### 2. **Basic Algebraic Simplifications**
   - **Description**: Apply simple algebraic rules, such as removing identity elements in addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.
   - **Example**: Simplify `x + 0` to `x`, `x * 1` to `x`, or `x ^ 1` to `x`.
   - **Why it's easy**: These rules are straightforward to detect and apply, and they don't require complex tree restructuring.
   - **Steps**: 
     - Traverse the expression tree.
     - Replace known patterns (e.g., `+ 0`, `* 1`, `^ 1`) with the simplified equivalent.
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduces expression size and redundant operations, improving both memory usage and speed.

### 3. **Precomputing Function Expression Trees**
   - **Description**: Build and simplify the expression tree for user-defined functions during the declaration process, rather than evaluating it repeatedly.
   - **Example**: Simplify a function `f(x) = x^2 + 2*x + 1` when it's declared and store the simplified form for later use.
   - **Why it's moderately easy**: It involves building the tree once and caching it, which avoids redundant parsing but may require adjustments to the function handling system.
   - **Steps**: 
     - Parse and simplify the function's expression tree during function declaration.
     - Store the simplified tree for use in evaluation, skipping parsing at runtime.
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduces repeated parsing and tree-building overhead for user-defined functions.

### 4. **Subexpression Elimination / Common Subexpression Optimization**
   - **Description**: Detect common subexpressions and compute them only once, reusing the result where needed.
   - **Example**: In the expression `x + (x + y) + (x + y)`, compute `x + y` once and reuse it.
   - **Why it's moderate in difficulty**: Requires tracking subexpressions during tree traversal and potentially restructuring the tree to cache results.
   - **Steps**: 
     - Identify common subtrees during expression tree traversal.
     - Store the computed result and replace identical subtrees with the cached result.
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduces repeated computations, especially in large or complex expressions.

### 5. **Expression Tree Simplification and Factoring**
   - **Description**: Simplify complex expressions by applying more advanced algebraic transformations, such as factoring quadratic expressions or distributing terms.
   - **Example**: Factor `x^2 + 2x + 1` into `(x + 1)^2` or distribute `2 * (x + y)` into `2x + 2y`.
   - **Why it's harder**: Requires recognizing more complex patterns and may involve non-trivial tree transformations.
   - **Steps**: 
     - Detect opportunities for factorization or distribution in the tree.
     - Transform the tree while maintaining the correct expression semantics.
   - **Expected Impact**: Can greatly simplify complex expressions and optimize execution, but itâ€™s more complex to implement and may not always result in simplification.

### 6. **Symbolic Differentiation** (Hardest)
   - **Description**: Implement symbolic differentiation to support advanced simplifications like detecting derivative identities or using simplifications that emerge from differentiation.
   - **Example**: Use differentiation to optimize or simplify complex expressions involving calculus, such as recognizing that the derivative of `sin(x)` times its integral cancels out.
   - **Why it's the hardest**: Requires symbolic handling of calculus operations, which is significantly more complex than simple algebraic simplifications. You may also need to integrate simplification rules for derivatives.
   - **Steps**:
     - Implement symbolic differentiation rules.
     - Integrate with your simplification routines to detect simplifiable patterns post-differentiation.
   - **Expected Impact**: This is more applicable in specific domains (e.g., optimization problems), but it adds powerful capabilities for calculus-related problems.

### Suggested Implementation Plan:
1. **Start with Constant Folding** and **Basic Algebraic Simplifications** as these are the easiest to implement and will provide immediate benefits in both performance and expression size reduction.
2. Once you have basic folding and simplifications, **Precompute Function Expression Trees** to avoid redundant work during function evaluation. This adds to the efficiency of the solver.
3. Then, move on to **Subexpression Elimination** for more advanced optimization, ensuring that redundant computations are detected and avoided.
4. Finally, tackle **Advanced Simplifications (Factoring and Distribution)** and **Symbolic Differentiation** once you've mastered the simpler techniques. These provide powerful capabilities but involve more complex logic.
