# Solver

**Solver** is a high-performance mathematical expression solver and parsing library written in C++ with Python bindings. It is designed to evaluate complex mathematical expressions—including those involving variables, constants, and user-defined functions—using advanced parsing techniques, caching, and optimization strategies. The library is ideal for scientific computing, data analysis, and applications where performance is critical.

## Features

- **Expression Parsing:**  
  Parse infix expressions into tokenized, flattened postfix representations or abstract syntax trees (AST) for evaluation.
  
- **Built-In & User-Defined Functions:**  
  Easily register standard functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `tan`) as well as declare custom functions using string expressions.

- **Caching and Performance:**  
  Uses two separate Least Recently Used (LRU) caches: one for evaluated results and one for compiled expressions. This minimizes repeated work by reusing parsed and compiled expressions.
  
- **Multiple Evaluation Modes:**  
  Evaluate single expressions, bulk evaluations over a range of values, or compute cartesian products of multiple variable ranges.
  
- **C++ and Python Integration:**  
  Compiled as a C++ library and exposed to Python via PyBind11. Use it in your Python projects or embed it in performance-critical C++ code.

- **AST and Postfix Evaluation:**  
  Supports both AST-based evaluation and simplified postfix evaluation pipelines, with built-in support for common algebraic simplifications.

## Requirements

- **Language & Compiler:**  
  C++23-compliant compiler
  
- **Build Tools:**  
  [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (minimum version 3.12), [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (optional, for code formatting)

- **Python:**  
  Python 3.8 or later

- **Dependencies:**  
  - [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)  
  - CMake, Clang (listed in `install_requires`)

## Installation & Build

### Using CMake

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rodrigo-Vildosola/SOLVER.git
   cd SOLVER
   ```

2. **Configure and build the library:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

   This will compile both the C++ library and the Python bindings.

### Using Setup.py

You can also build and install the Python module using the provided `setup.py`. The build system leverages CMake internally:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py install
```

This will compile the shared library and generate Python stub files and an `__init__.py` for easy importing.

## Usage Examples

Here is a simple example showing how to use **Solver** from Python:

```python
from solver import Solver
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a solver instance.
solver = Solver()

# Optionally, disable caching for testing:
solver.setUseCache(False)

# Declare a constant and a variable.
solver.declareConstant("pi", np.pi)
solver.declareVariable("x", 10)

# Declare a user-defined function.
solver.declareFunction("func", ["z"], "z + 20")

# Evaluate some expressions.
result1 = solver.evaluate("tan(pi / 4)", debug=True)
print(f"tan(pi / 4) = {result1}")

result2 = solver.evaluate("func(10) + 40", debug=True)
print(f"func(10) + 40 = {result2}")

# Evaluate an expression for a range of values.
x_values = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)
results = solver.evaluateForRange("x", x_values.tolist(), "x^3 + 2*x + 1", debug=True)

# Plot the results.
plt.plot(x_values, results, label="x^3 + 2x + 1")
plt.title("Single Variable Expressions")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("f(x)")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## API Overview

The **Solver** class exposes methods to:

- **Declare Symbols:**  
  `declareConstant(name, value)` and `declareVariable(name, value)`

- **Expression Evaluation:**  
  `evaluate(expression, debug=False)`  
  `evaluateForRange(variable, values, expression, debug=False)`  
  `evaluateForRanges(variables, valuesSets, expression, debug=False)`

- **Function Registration:**  
  `registerPredefinedFunction(name, callback, argCount)`  
  `declareFunction(name, args, expression)`

- **Caching:**  
  Enable or disable caching with `setUseCache(useCache)` and clear caches with `clearCache()`.

- **Parsing:**  
  `setCurrentExpression(expression, debug)` parses an expression into a flattened postfix form, and `setCurrentExpressionAST(expression, debug=False)` builds an AST.
