## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust C++ library capable of both symbolic and numerical equation solving. The library will allow users to input equations in a human-readable form, process them into an internal representation, and apply various solving techniques depending on the equation type. This document outlines the overall design, data structures, algorithms, and design patterns to guide the development process.

## 2. Project Goals and Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Parsing:** Accept equations in infix notation and convert them into an internal representation.
- **Symbolic Manipulation:** Support expression simplification, differentiation, expansion, and factorization.
- **Numerical Solving:** Provide methods such as Newton–Raphson, bisection, and secant for approximating solutions.
- **Equation Solving:** Handle linear, polynomial, and transcendental equations as well as systems of equations.
- **Extensibility:** Allow easy integration of new solving algorithms and transformation rules.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Optimize for speed by sharing common subexpressions and caching intermediate results.
- **Maintainability:** Use clear modular design and established design patterns.
- **Scalability:** Structure code to support future extensions like partial differential equations or advanced symbolic capabilities.
- **Portability:** Ensure compatibility with common C++ compilers and cross-platform builds.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The architecture is layered, separating parsing, internal representation, transformation, and solving:

1. **Input Parsing Layer:**  
   - Converts user input (infix expressions) into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using parsing algorithms.

2. **Expression Representation Layer:**  
   - Represents mathematical expressions using ASTs or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to share common subexpressions.
   - Uses symbol tables (hash maps) to keep track of variables and their values.

3. **Transformation & Manipulation Layer:**  
   - Applies term rewriting and pattern matching to simplify or transform expressions.
   - Uses visitors to perform operations like differentiation or simplification.

4. **Equation Solving Layer:**  
   - Routes the problem to either a symbolic solver (using substitution, elimination, or Grobner bases) or a numerical solver (Newton–Raphson, bisection, etc.).
   - Applies the Strategy pattern to select the appropriate solving algorithm based on the problem type.

5. **Output/Interface Layer:**  
   - Provides a user-friendly API for inputting equations and retrieving solutions.
   - (Optional) Supports a command-line or GUI-based interface for interactive use.

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1 Expression Trees / Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- **Purpose:** Represent each equation or expression as a tree where nodes are operations/functions and leaves are constants or variables.
- **Example:** The expression `3*(x + 2)` would have a multiplication node at the root with children representing `3` and the subtree for `(x + 2)`.

### 4.2 Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- **Purpose:** Optimize performance by reusing nodes for common subexpressions.
- **Example:** For `x^2 + x^2`, a DAG will represent both occurrences of `x^2` with a single node.

### 4.3 Symbol Tables / Hash Tables
- **Purpose:** Map variable names to their values or subexpressions.
- **Usage:** Facilitate quick lookups during evaluation and simplification.

### 4.4 Collections (Arrays / Linked Lists)
- **Purpose:** Manage polynomial terms or collections of subexpressions that require ordered processing.

## 5. Core Algorithms

### 5.1 Parsing Algorithms
- **Shunting-yard Algorithm:**  
  - Converts infix expressions into postfix notation or directly into an AST.
- **Recursive Descent Parsing:**  
  - Implements a top-down parser that can process expressions based on a well-defined grammar.

### 5.2 Term Rewriting and Pattern Matching
- **Techniques:**
  - Define rules to recognize algebraic identities and simplify expressions.
  - Iteratively apply these rules until no further transformation is possible.
- **Example:** Transform `2*x + 3*x` into `5*x`.

### 5.3 Equation Solving Algorithms

#### Symbolic Methods:
- **Substitution & Elimination:**  
  - Isolate and substitute variables in simple linear or non-linear systems.
- **Grobner Bases:**  
  - For solving systems of polynomial equations symbolically.

#### Numerical Methods:
- **Newton–Raphson Method:**  
  - Iteratively approximates roots of equations with a good initial guess.
- **Bisection & Secant Methods:**  
  - Provide alternatives for root finding where derivative information is not available or reliable.

## 6. Design Patterns

### 6.1 Composite Pattern
- **Usage:**  
  - Model the tree-like structure of expressions, allowing uniform treatment of individual components and composites.

### 6.2 Visitor Pattern
- **Usage:**  
  - Traverse ASTs/DAGs to perform operations like evaluation, simplification, differentiation, and code generation.

### 6.3 Strategy Pattern
- **Usage:**  
  - Enable switching between different solving techniques (symbolic vs. numerical) based on the equation’s characteristics.

### 6.4 Factory Pattern
- **Usage:**  
  - Centralize creation of different node types within the AST, ensuring consistency and easing modifications.

### 6.5 Interpreter Pattern (Optional)
- **Usage:**  
  - Directly execute or “interpret” mathematical expressions represented by the AST, especially for immediate evaluations.
